# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Apply a cohesive, responsive, modern, and simple UI theme across the entire frontend (login, header, dashboard, and all tabs) that looks polished in both light and dark mode.

**Planned changes:**
- Define and apply shared Tailwind tokens/CSS variables for colors, typography, spacing, and elevation to ensure a consistent look across all screens.
- Refine responsive layout behavior for header branding/actions, dashboard tab navigation, and primary content containers across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints.
- Standardize UI composition for core elements (cards, tables/lists, dialogs, forms, and empty/loading states) to be modern and consistent without changing existing interactions or features.

**User-visible outcome:** The app’s UI looks uniformly modern and simple across all pages, adapts cleanly to mobile/tablet/desktop sizes without overflow, and remains readable and polished in both light and dark mode while preserving existing functionality.
